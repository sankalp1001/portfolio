## Projects

### Detection of Different Types of OCT Diseases
- Developed an algorithm to classify 1,00,000+ OCT images into multiple classes to detect retinal diseases.
- Used multiple pretrained CNNs for feature extraction and employed SVM for classification.
- Achieved an accuracy of 93% with 10-fold cross-validation.

### House Price Prediction
- Optimized data readiness for robust training and testing.
- Employed techniques like one-hot encoding for categorical variables, which led to an average accuracy improvement of 2.5% across models.

### Line Follower Bot
- Developed a line follower bot using an ATmega16 and IR sensors with a reaction time of about 0.5 seconds.
- Optimized signal reception and turning algorithms for precise tracing capability.
